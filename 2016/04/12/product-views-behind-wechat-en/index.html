The work came from a special internal talk in Tencent on July 24, 2012. The original talk was 8 hours and 20 minutes long with a 180+ pages PPT. Excluding the confidential part, a 139-page PPT was published.<br>I wrote this article to summarize the PPT to one article, and translated to English for the world.<br>You can find link to Chinese version at bottom. </p>

<p>p5: Product Managers sit by the God</p>
<ul>
<li>They know humanity.</li>
<li>They Know psychology of the mass.</li>
<li>Product Managers are like the God. They build system, make rules, and let the mass evolve in the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>p6: Know the reactor of the environment</p>
<ul>
<li>My experiment: the difference between making weibo (Chinese twitter) posts on the go and on desktop: desktop screen(weibo post iteself, content) is also environment.</li>
<li>The people you followed in weibo is your world.</li>
<li>The difference between photo taking in friend zone and Qzone album.</li>
<li>Product builds the environment and determines user reaction.  </li>
</ul>
<p>p7: People are lazy</p>
<ul>
<li>Laziness results in invention.</li>
<li>Lazyness powers innovation.</li>
<li>Case: voice search contacts.</li>
</ul>
<p>p8: Fasion is the drive.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Because everyone else is using it.”</li>
<li>People follow.</li>
<li>For internet products, fashion is a key drive.</li>
<li>Don’t over-instrumentalize.</li>
</ul>
<p>p9: People are impatient</p>
<ul>
<li>Users are not patient enough to read your instructions.</li>
<li>If you can’t make user fall in love with you in one minute…</li>
<li>Don’t grab users to use you product if your product is not good enough yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>p10: People don’t like studying.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sunset of blog. RSS?</li>
<li>Toilet principle: don’t feed long content that user can’t read through on toilet.</li>
</ul>
<p>p11: People are a crowd</p>
<ul>
<li>The crowd : a study of the popular mind</li>
<li>Crowd IQ is below individual IQ.</li>
<li>Internet products face the crow rather than individuals.</li>
<li>Don’t treat the crowd in the way you treat individuals, especially in internet products.</li>
</ul>
<p>p12: Value diaosi grassroot users</p>
<ul>
<li>#Thinking Everyday# facebook, pinterest, instagram, path etc. solve the problem of existence feeling. Existence feeling is that people feel lost and undervalued when they detach from SNS. Such products can’t be popular in China, because Chinese face another problem which is at a lower level than existence feeling which is the living feeling. But the diaosi grassroot group in China have pressure of living, and also long for existence feeling. To understand the mainstream user feelings and needs, we need to start from diaosi grassroot users.</li>
</ul>
<p>p13: Find the essance from everyday experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Galaxy Note: Fashion? Easier for long-nail users to type.</li>
<li>Touchable switch is closer to human than traditional switch.</li>
<li>Great products should satisfy emotional needs. </li>
</ul>
<p>p14: Let non-weibo users to use your product</p>
<ul>
<li>They are the mainstream users who are too lazy to use weibo.</li>
<li>They are around you.</li>
<li>Keep it in mind, they are your users.</li>
</ul>
<p>p15: Humanization is emphathy.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t understand others, but you can understand yourself.</li>
<li>You need to understand common psychologies of human. </li>
</ul>
<p>p16: Need is to satisfy people’s greed, anger and madness.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ultimate goal of products is to satisfy humanity needs.</li>
<li>Don’t add your moral sense to products.</li>
<li>Satisfy greed, anger and madness, but also ask users to send fewer wechat messages. It is a ridiculous world.</li>
<li>“Product is a combination of technology and art.” Steve Jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>p17: New ideas are 99% wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most “I have a good idea” cases are way far from the needs.</li>
<li>Don’t imagine needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>p18: Don’t build whatever user asks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t satisfy their needs directly.</li>
<li>User needs are scattered. Solution is to abstract them.</li>
<li>User feedbacks can only help you learn about their thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>p19: Most new functions can be cut off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think it back, how many features did you build which turns to be unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>p20: Don’t find needs from peer products.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is doodle important?</li>
<li>You can’t understand needs deeply from peer products.</li>
</ul>
<p>p21: Don’t listen to needs from PM.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not users but think they represent users.</li>
<li>Their analysis are too rational.</li>
<li>They will ask you to add features like, online or not, sent to phone or not, read or not, grouping, photo filter, doodle, sync across multi-platforms, save messages on cloud, send text, picture and video together to timeline, multi-avatars, like on avatars, PC version, auto-import friends from contacts, group name card, and so on … “Please go and use other products.”</li>
</ul>
<p>p22: Needs come from your understanding of users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Needs are not from survey.</li>
<li>Needs are not from analysis.</li>
<li>Needs are not from discussion.</li>
<li>Needs are not from competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>p23: Feel the users trends from weibo</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend 1 hour daily on wechat to see how they use your products.</li>
<li>Their scenarios, feelings, etc.</li>
<li>What is the time trends of their era?</li>
<li>Ignore opinions from critics.</li>
<li>Wait for them to say “it was fun!”</li>
</ul>
<p>p24: Get insights from user discussions</p>
<ul>
<li>The weibo posts are reactions from real scenarios.</li>
<li>Case: Stone, scissors, cloth.</li>
<li>Nothing can stop human from playing stone, scissors and cloth on wechat voice chat.</li>
</ul>
<p>p25: Each epoch has its own product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep sharp on time trends</li>
<li>From QQ to WeChat.</li>
</ul>
<p>p26: Satisfy your own needs by satisfying user needs</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t truly understand others.</li>
<li>You can’t satisfy massive individual needs.</li>
<li>Most people think in the same way. Capture the real massive needs from yourself.</li>
<li>Case: read.</li>
<li>Case: voice to input reminder, voice search on people.</li>
</ul>
<p>p27: Find the psychological appeals behind needs</p>
<ul>
<li>Needs can be summarized as psychological appeals.</li>
<li>Floating bottles: satisfy the appeal to speak and curiosity. It’s a great example of psychological drive. People have such a strong desire to tell, even as competitive as mail.</li>
<li>If we build floating bottle just for social, we won’t get the essence. (Case: send floating bottles or text?)  </li>
</ul>
<p>p28: The drive of psychological satisfaction is way better than tools, even better than saving money.</p>
<ul>
<li>An alternative money-saving text tool won’t succeed. We would be in trouble if we target at a money-saving tool.</li>
<li>WeChat is not QQ. “WeChat is a life style”.</li>
<li>WeChat is a life style. It reflects the priority of psychological satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>p29: “Cool” wins over features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool! (Goal of marketing is to make users feel cool.)</li>
<li>It was fun! (You get it if weibo posts say it was fun.)</li>
<li>Cool is the foundation for word-of-mouth broadcasting.</li>
<li>Cool is the experience. Experience is easier than feature to be broadcasted.</li>
</ul>
<p>p30: Build for the mass effect: nearby people</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: nearby people.</li>
<li>If it’s not for stranger social, it’s for curiosity.</li>
<li>What will happen?</li>
<li>It has the social effects. Everyone is observing and observed in the meanwhile.</li>
<li>For the first time, they saw each other in real life.</li>
</ul>
<p>p31: Build for the mass effect: shaking</p>
<ul>
<li>People like simple actions.</li>
<li>People are curious of randomness.</li>
<li>People are curious of peers from diversified spaces.</li>
<li>It has mass effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>p32: Build for the idea: friend zone</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea: People need to gain existence feeling from attention of friends. Photo is the perfect medium for interactions. People just need 3 or 5 friends. People don’t want to expose their friends, but want to be in a crowd.</li>
<li>A more private community than facebook and path.</li>
<li>Build it because you want to use it yourself. </li>
</ul>
<p>p33: Focus on main scenario, don’t build complete features.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s easy to build to be big and complete, but hard to build less.</li>
<li>If you don’t have the ability to simplify complexities, control your desire to build more.</li>
<li>Building more comes from your inconfidence.</li>
<li>The coolness of finding some needs each day is much more rewarding than proposing some needs.</li>
<li>Case: friend zone only allows photo posts. Writing 140 characters is much harder than a photo.</li>
</ul>
<p>p34: Don’t reversly infer needs from strategy analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft, Nokia, Google</li>
</ul>
<p>p35: It’s a lie that we get needs from survey.</p>
<ul>
<li>The needs got from mass surveys are not true. (For the need of a group, users will tell you that they want QQ group.)</li>
<li>User feedbacks help improve experiences. But they won’t tell you anything new to build.</li>
<li>The needs from stats are even a lie.</li>
</ul>
<p>p36: Needs are from the curiosity to mass effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating bottle</li>
<li>Nearby people</li>
<li>Shaking</li>
</ul>
<p>p37: Needs are from self needs and nearby friend feedbacks</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
<li>Web WeChat</li>
<li>TODO on top.</li>
<li>Migration when switching phones.</li>
</ul>
<p>p38: Needs are from understanding of current life trends</p>
<ul>
<li>Friend zone: People need to gain existence feeling from interactions with friends safely, and feel comfortable.</li>
</ul>
<p>p39: Needs are from understanding of platforms</p>
<ul>
<li>Open platform interface is beautiful</li>
<li>Open platform ecosystem is alluring</li>
<li>Open platform brings the uncertainty worth to wait.</li>
<li>Ecosystem instead of individual products</li>
</ul>
<p>p40: Needs are from understanding of information flow</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription platform: make all messages pushable</li>
<li>Every individual can be outstanding</li>
<li>Broadcast brands via friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>p41:<br><img src="/images/wechat_p41.png" alt=""></p>
<p>p42: Needs are from building new system</p>
<ul>
<li>Popularize QR code so it becomes the entrance.</li>
<li>Satisfy crowd’s psychological or economical needs by building simple rules and self-sustained system.</li>
</ul>
<p>p43: Determine new version features by last minute</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t pre-plan features for new versions. Determine features of next version when current version is finished.</li>
<li>Plan in mind about all possible features.</li>
<li>Important features will come up to you at the right time.</li>
<li>Case: nearby people.</li>
</ul>
<p>p44: World is new</p>
<ul>
<li>Forget old data and even experience.</li>
<li>Be sharp on current and future trends.</li>
<li>PC’s entrance is search box, mobile entrance is QR code. </li>
</ul>
<p>p45: We get products by its evolvement, rather than plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>The TODOs of each WeChat version were determined only after the last version was published.</li>
<li>It’s impossible to know what the product is like in next half year. Planning is a lie.</li>
<li>It’s better to determine product version later, and do it based on current users and judgement on the current environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>p46: The products with DNA will evolve.</p>
<ul>
<li>DNA is the values and insights of a product.</li>
<li>If we view product as a living object, it has its DNA.</li>
</ul>
<p>p47: Mass effect is the core of social products</p>
<ul>
<li>By knowing inner human desires, build virtual society rules, trigger mass effect, and let the mass push the rules to evolve.</li>
<li>Case: how to play with celebrities? </li>
</ul>
<p>p48: It is not right to put users to low, middle and high brackets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build products that everyone loves.</li>
<li>It’s not professional to build generic products in a young-age way.</li>
<li>People are equal in front of products.<br><img src="/images/wechat_p48.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>p49: Build product structure first, then functional details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Product structure is the skeleton, not changeful or complex.</li>
<li>Create from skeleton, not muscles.</li>
<li>Case: WeChat product structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>p50: The organic relationship between functional modules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: friend zone and album.</li>
<li>Don’t build multi-avatar for multi-avatar.</li>
</ul>
<p>p51: Design is classification</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification is how human brain recognizes patterns.</li>
<li>Classification is one way to simply complexities.</li>
<li>PM should think how to organize issues every day.</li>
<li>Case: WeChat always only have 4 bottom tabs.<br><img src="/images/wechat_p51.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>p52: Abstract so that we can simply complexities</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract is to extract common features of things.</li>
<li>Abstract use simple model to cover varieties.</li>
<li>Highly abstract brings simplicity.</li>
<li>Case: the atomic items in friend zone content.</li>
<li>Case: one account to cover celebrity, artists, company, restaurants, online media, paper media, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>p53: The easier the classification, the easier it gets accepted</p>
<ul>
<li>QQMail is not getting more complex</li>
<li>WeChat will upgrade, but the structure (and interface) will stay simple.</li>
</ul>
<p>p54: Find the core needs behind needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: build grouping of contacts for friend zone?</li>
<li>Users say they want grouping, but the actual need is to block specific users.</li>
<li>In case you built grouping, few people will use.</li>
</ul>
<p>p55: Design based on scenarios, rather than feature list.</p>
<ul>
<li>“If you want feature X, buy a HTC/Samsung whatever instead” by Jony</li>
<li>Don’t put features altogether. Features serve scenarios and whole experience. No feature is independent.</li>
<li>Case: link keyboard, or wechat web?</li>
<li>Case: auto-play, or drive mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>p56: Make choices when facing scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Online status? Mobile users are always online.</li>
<li>PC version? PC users could be offline, not as realtime as SMS.</li>
<li>Help people get rid of habit to say “88” (Chinese sound of bye) in QQ.</li>
</ul>
<p>p57: Keep features in the air (pony’s words)</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: Restaurant business plugin is invisible, it is only visible after user scan.</li>
<li>Unnoticable changes in new versions.</li>
<li>Only showcase new features for new users.</li>
</ul>
<p>p58: Differences between mobile and PC</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile phones are extensions of human body. It is connected with human via all kinds of sensors. PC is outside things.</li>
<li>Mobile internet products are not basic migrations from PC to phone.</li>
<li>There won’t be this PPT without mobile phone. (It is from my evernote pieces where I type my ideas from time to time, which can’t be done on desktop.)</li>
<li>We build internet products with no web version.</li>
</ul>
<p>p59: Don’t over-design.</p>
<ul>
<li>The more you build, the more mistakes you make.</li>
<li>Polish the main trunk, don’t go too deep to the branches.</li>
<li>Case: nearby people.</li>
</ul>
<p>p60: We would rather sacrifice function instead of affecting experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t add entrances just for traffic.</li>
<li>Case: why can’t we add edit button on upper-left corner?</li>
</ul>
<p>p61: Product, or operation?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do things that make your work easier in the future.</li>
<li>Are you building a Class, or an Instance?</li>
<li>Good features don’t need regular additions, it can be done in one shot.</li>
<li>The differences between QQ floating bottle and WeChat floating bottle.</li>
<li>Good products will call the users. (pony’s words)</li>
</ul>
<p>p62: Let users drive users</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than system admin</li>
<li>Case: how to make users setup avatars.</li>
</ul>
<p>p63: Extremely simple so that it can’t be surpassed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: Shaking. In my reply to pony: “Shaking is hard to be surpassed, because we have made it extremely simple.”</li>
</ul>
<p>p64: Design for screnarios in 2 years</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: Sent status? Network conditions should be good enough in next 2 years, so messages must can be sent successfully.</li>
</ul>
<p>p65: The responsiveness is No.1 experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: the fluency of friend zone timeline</li>
</ul>
<p>p66: We would rather not to do it if the feature doesn’t excite us.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t really understand things which doesn’t excite you.</li>
<li>Curiosity drives PM.</li>
<li>The logic perfectness is also exciting.</li>
<li>Gain word of mouth from single points, rather than unnecessary features.</li>
<li>(Case: QQ Mailbox transfer station)</li>
</ul>
<p>p67: Keep the changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t do things in 1.0 which should be done in 2.0</li>
<li>For uncertainties, keep the change, don’t do it for now.</li>
<li>Launch is for verifying ideas, and it is a start of improvement.</li>
<li>Case: WeChat web, won’t be a product of complete features.</li>
<li>Case: feature to reply friend zone posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>p68: If there is no organic growth, no need to promote.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can only leave users bad impressions if we import users by force, and they will never come back.</li>
<li>KPI is side products of good products, and we should not change products for KPI.</li>
</ul>
<p>p69: Keep coarse, keep awkward.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put it aside if there is no better solution.</li>
<li>Case: the problem of sending message to a wrong group.</li>
<li>Case: group name card, group blocking.</li>
<li>Focus on big scenarios, ignore small ones.</li>
<li>If it is unimportant feature, put it in settings. But it’d be better if we don’t do it at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>p70: If the solution is too complicated, the problem must be wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: video chat.</li>
</ul>
<p>p71: Show your perception in every detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you satisfy with every detail.</li>
<li>It is good enough if you are satisfied? Depends on your level.</li>
<li>Case: “from iPhone” or “from Shenzhen”</li>
</ul>
<p>p72: Give user the choices</p>
<ul>
<li>Except core concept, build others as detachable plugins.</li>
<li>Keep it simple.</li>
</ul>
<p>p73: Respect your users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect user privacy (ask user to confirm before uploading contacts, let user know if LBS location is exposed)</li>
<li>Don’t induce users.</li>
<li>Weigh user on every experience point. Case: add protection for user-input content in edit column in case of crash.</li>
<li>Case: use real PM signature in system messages, instead of “system admin” which is a machine-like thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>p74: Only one version for the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: mailbox.</li>
<li>Case: i18n of WeChat. WeChat won’t push localization versions for each region, but keep only one version for the global.</li>
</ul>
<p>p75: Build user experiences to extremes is also innovation. (pony’s words)</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiment of putting it close to ears. Why the screen won’t switch to earphone when we use hands to cover iPhone screen, but the ears can? Why WeChat can detect your ears?</li>
</ul>
<p>p76: Your values (attitudes) determines product features.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to decide whether to build photo filters and how to?</li>
<li>Rational analysis is about material gain which is not perfect.</li>
<li>It depends on your attitude to photos. Will everyday photos be more beautiful with or without filters?</li>
</ul>
<p>p77: Change user habits</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone is used to annoy people in past 100+ years after it was invented.</li>
<li>WeChat has video chat, but it won’t ring people up in a sudden.</li>
<li>You can’t reinvent phones, but you can change how people make calls.</li>
<li>New habits make user more comfortable.</li>
</ul>
<p>p78: Get rid of anti-human innovations</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovation is not based on inference.</li>
<li>Innovation serves people.</li>
<li>“Should you do anything to show intelligence, or choose virtue?” by Bezos.</li>
<li>Case: How about push once to speak instead of hold? It is unacceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>p78: Don’t let strategy behaviour take the palce of true needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid “build through”. The needs which needs to be built through is no longer needs.</li>
<li>Avoid “integrate”. The needs which needs integration are sunset needs.</li>
<li>Avoid “pull up”. The needs which needs “pull up” is like KPI.</li>
<li>Avoid “import”. The needs which needs importing is no longer live.</li>
<li>Avoid “multi-platform”. Don’t do multi-platform for multi-platform.</li>
<li>Avoid “everything”. The things which cover everything is mediocre.</li>
</ul>
<p>p80: Start from people to change business patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the brand broadcast via friends.</li>
<li>Media is going eletronic.</li>
<li>How celebrities talk with people one by one.</li>
</ul>
<p>p81: There is no design but problem solving.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t lead by design.</li>
<li>Lead by users.</li>
</ul>
<p>p82: Innovate, or copy?</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t reinvent phones.</li>
<li>But everything you do can be new.</li>
<li>Follow your users rather than competitive products.</li>
<li>Let products talk.</li>
</ul>
<p>p83: The evolvement story of friend zone</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat all kinds of PK scenarios.</li>
<li>Simulate the massive behaviours after the crowd enters the scenarios in your mind.</li>
<li>Find the keys, give up branches (comments, replies, grouping and blocking)</li>

<p>p84: Chapter of Nature</p>
<p>p85: Views on Nature</p>
<ul>
<li>Nature is human instinct behaviours and psychological reactions.</li>
<li>Inspiration on products: simple and no need rethinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>p86: Phase out technology thinking</p>
<ul>
<li>See how iOS hides technology: File? Folder? Uninstall? Process?</li>
<li>The complex technology should be hidden behind extremely simple use cases.</li>
<li>Products are built with rationals, but we use products to express emotions.</li>
<li>Don’t use word “support” in product instructions.</li>
<li>“Support XXX feature” is an outdated product expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>p87: Shaking: a chained natural effects.</p>
<p>p88: Let interaction simulates the nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build animation effects close to nature: the animation in friend zone comments.</li>
<li>Interaction is to gain feedbacks. Produce feedbacks as many as possible.</li>
<li>Generate natural and easy-to-understand feedbacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>p89: Single path</p>
<ul>
<li>A longer path with certainty is better than providing multiple paths which need users to think.</li>
<li>Home key</li>
<li>Shortcuts are not important but unreliable.</li>
<li>Don’t combine multiple functions in one operation as it increases complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>p90: “Cool” is the future experience direction</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool is natural and simple</li>
<li>Case: grab photos from the air</li>
</ul>
<p>p91: Build features which can be learnt in 3 seconds</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all text instructions (at least hide them)</li>
<li>Case: instruction illustration for shaking</li>
<li>Clarity and easy-to-understand win all decorations.</li>
</ul>
<p>p92: “Management” is unnatural</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t involve user into management.</li>
<li>Calendar?</li>
<li>Grouping in contacts? (Weibo grouping, Google+)</li>
</ul>
<p>p93: Single clue is the most beautiful one.</p>
<ul>
<li>1D &gt; 2D</li>
<li>Twitter and Weibo timeline represent 1D</li>
<li>1D for mailbox? How about reading mails like Twitter?</li>
<li>Try not to use tab or dropdown list in mobile screens as it adds dimension.</li>
<li>How about Facebook’s sliding “drawer” design.</li>
</ul>
<p>p94: Changing skins (themes) shows inconfidence</p>
<ul>
<li>It shows inconfidence on default skin and loses visual brand effect (except products like weico app whose selling point is personalized design).</li>
<li>Focus on default skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>p95: Don’t let user choose</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide only one most general pattern.</li>
<li>Don’t provide alternative solutions to choose (like cascading and waterfalls)</li>
<li>Every additional choice confuses user and brings uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<p>p96: Again, why there is no “sent” or “read”?</p>
<ul>
<li>If we need to look back to see if the message was sent, delivered, or read after we send every message, it is too much a burden and unacceptable.</li>
<li>Messages with tails are not simple or natural.</li>
<li>Nature is an instinct.</li>
</ul>
<p>p97: Fewer is better than more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Too much content breaks community atmosphere.</li>
<li>Too many friends create social terror.</li>
<li>Too much attention leads to unattractiveness.</li>
<li>Case: WeChat won’t import phone contacts or QQ friends.</li>
<li>Case: friend zone won’t import QQ Zone blogs.</li>
</ul>
<p>p98: 100 Millions is just one user</p>
<ul>
<li>They are the same.</li>
<li>You can simulate them naturally if you listen to their needs widely and understand their needs.</li>
<li>You will know their feelings.</li>
<li>Keep the 100 Million users in your heart.</li>
</ul>
<p>p99: Switch to a dummy user in one second.</p>
<ul>
<li>Train yourself the ability to switch to a dummy user in one second.</li>
<li>Know how people use products via large amounts of CE</li>
<li>Experience the products as a dummy user so that you can find the problems.</li>
<li>Focus on first-time experience, because you can’t find new problems once you are familiar with the product.</li>
</ul>
<p>p100: Train your instinct on the nature</p>
<ul>
<li>Form instinct by analyzing thousands of problems.</li>
<li>Empty your previous experience, look the world in more instinct eyes. Like to phrase out the favor of technology.</li>
<li>The solution of complex problems may not come from induction but from intuition.</li>
</ul>
<p>p101: PM’s mentality</p>
<ul>
<li>Fight for knowledge, not pride.</li>
<li>Give up emotions to know the problem deeper.</li>
<li>You shortcomings could be your strengths. E.g. people who fear social may know how to make social products.</li>
</ul>
<p>p102: Chapter of Quality</p>
<p>p103: Ambition to change the old world.</p>
<ul>
<li>My only expectation on iPhone5 is that it doesn’t support phones just like iPad (3G). So that I can save on phone bills. But you can text me via kik, call me via Google Voice, video chat via facetime.</li>
<li>On the last day before WeChat project proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>p104: Have your own ideas and wishes</p>
<ul>
<li>WeChat is “a new life style”.</li>
<li>It determines the altitude of your products.</li>
<li>Your altitude will be reflected in every detail, unavoidably. </li>
</ul>
<p>p105: WeChat is “a life style”</p>
<ul>
<li>It is “a”, rather than “one kind of”.</li>
<li>It is the difference between WeChat and QQ.</li>
</ul>
<p>p106: QQ Mailbox: Keep in touch.</p>
<p>p107: Convey culture minds via tech products.</p>
<ul>
<li>One thousand people have one thousand feelings.</li>
<li>Wechat startup pictures.</li>
</ul>
<p>p108: “Send fewer WeChat messages”</p>
<ul>
<li>What else products ask users to use less? (Besides cigaretts)</li>
<li>It reflects your understanding level on products and users.</li>
<li>Don’t build it for marketing. Because it will have marketing effects itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>p109: Make the welcome page as your product release conference.</p>
<ul>
<li>New features list shows a tech mindset.</li>
<li>Don’t do product release conference.</li>
<li>Every welcome page is a story.</li>
<li>It is one of the fewer places where you can express feelings.</li>
<li>Make the product worth expecting.</li>
</ul>
<p>p110: Programmers who don’t listen to rock music are not good PM</p>
<ul>
<li>Rock shows anti-tradition, humanity, freedom, etc.</li>
<li>Rock helps us find instinct status. Such status will be reflected in products.</li>
<li>Story of Pink Floyd and MJ.</li>
<li>“We won’t give you gift iPad!”</li>
<li>Keep special minds, do special things.</li>
</ul>
<p>p111: Advertise which is human friendly</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t advertise for advertisement.</li>
<li>Feelings from users are the best. (Many are from user original words in weibo, like “WeChat: Make voice coquettish again.”)</li>
<li>The WeChat ads in mailbox.</li>
</ul>
<p>p112:<br><img src="/images/wechat_p112.png" alt=""></p>
<p>p113:<br><img src="/images/wechat_p113.png" alt=""></p>
<p>p114: Find best partners.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuzki</li>
<li>Photographers of National Geography</li>
<li>Nike</li>
</ul>
<p>p115:<br><img src="/images/wechat_p115.png" alt=""></p>
<p>p116: Words reflect personal quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Words in products is talking to users. It reflects your quality.</li>
<li>Easy-to-understand shows your have clear minds.</li>
<li>Don’t ingratiate users or play yourself up. Treat users as friends.</li>
<li>Case: reminder before posting photos, login.</li>
</ul>
<p>p117: Some words to avoid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinese “ba”.</li>
<li>Chinese “oh”.</li>
<li>Force user do things reluctantly. (“Why don’t you invite friends now?””)</li>
<li>Success. (“You have saved it successfully.” Could they fail to save?)</li>
<li>Chinese version of “you” which shows respect.</li>
</ul>
<p>p118: Feeling of Future</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual keywords: future, tech, abstract, simple.</li>
<li>Forget Chinese elements.</li>
<li>Abstract or simulate reality?</li>
<li>You can only apply it once you feel the beauty of simplicity.</li>
<li>Shall we show blue sky and white cloud when video chatting in Beijing? (luke and pony’s opinions)</li>
</ul>
<p>p119: Do you have competitors or not?</p>
<ul>
<li>Most important thing is what do you want. Rather than what others are doing.</li>
<li>WeChat has no competitors, and we don’t analyze competitors.</li>
<li>They are not our PM.</li>
<li>We would rather focus the future instead of focus on peers.</li>
</ul>
<p>p120: Works, not products.</p>
<ul>
<li>Works will beat material gain products. (Steve Jobs comments on the race with Microsoft in this way.)</li>
<li>Works are longing for perfection.</li>
</ul>
<p>p121: Artisan, not designers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize 10 details every day (the inconvenient parts which you and surrounding people experienced)</li>
<li>Every detail which you did is creation which includes your views, ideas and choices on implementations.</li>
<li>Don’t talk about design out of nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>p122: Build products with soul</p>
<ul>
<li>Soul: organically connected structure (product structure), with muscle (features), with quality (values), agile response (high speed), rationals (clear logic, reasonable interactions), speaking (copywriting).</li>
<li>Just like a human, it is complete and in a harmony, and it’s not a Schizy.</li>
<li>Products have personality. It may not be perfect, but it should be elegant from outside, harmonious inside, like artwork.</li>
</ul>
<p>p123: Free individuals</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet products should make individual more free.</li>
<li>How should we change weibo comment system?</li>
<li>Personalized longtail product is the future.</li>
<li>Industrilization satisfies low cost, personalization creates special value.</li>
</ul>
<p>p124: Chapter of UI</p>
<p>p125: UI is to talk to users by products.</p>
<p>p126: Forbid use of competitor products</p>
<ul>
<li>UI designers are forbidden to use competitor products so they won’t be misled.</li>
<li>PM can use, but shouldn’t use much.</li>
</ul>
<p>p127: UI focuses features, not the other way around.</p>
<ul>
<li>Features come first before UI.</li>
<li>Don’t change scenario or feature just for a better UI idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>p128: Being organized wins visual display.</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification, and classification!</li>
<li>Cascading relationship shows classification.</li>
<li>Being organized is more important than being convenient.</li>
<li>Case: input box in dialogue, one line or two line?</li>
</ul>
<p>p129: Should there be only pattern.</p>
<ul>
<li>To keep consistency in a application, we should only allow one font, one control, one pattern and one background … </li>
<li>Various displays confuse user.</li>
<li>Try to use standard interfaces.</li>
<li>Being reasonable is more important than personality.</li>
</ul>
<p>p130: One theme in every interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Photography principle: every photo should have only one theme.</li>
<li>Don’t use bi-column interface.</li>
<li>Highlight themes.</li>
</ul>
<p>p131: Every dialogue box has a highlighted default button</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t make me think.</li>
<li>Case: send original picture is confusing. </li>
</ul>
<p>p132: Keep improving most frequent operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The smoothness of auto pulling for scrolling back to the top.</li>
<li>Evolvement of chat background</li>
</ul>
<p>p133: Features which need text instruction is not good experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t assume people will read text instructions.</li>
<li>Don’t assume user will study background.</li>
<li>Be able to use even without explaining.</li>
<li>Use less tips which are like patches.</li>
</ul>
<p>p134: Hide numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>N photos</li>
<li>N contacts</li>
<li>78.56% downloading</li>
</ul>
<p>p135: Explore new interactions on phones</p>
<ul>
<li>Phones are often used on the go.</li>
<li>Phones are extensions of the body and have more sensors.</li>
<li>Case: how to recognize people in the house.</li>
<li>Case: auto scaling down when showing friend zone photos.</li>
</ul>
<p>p136: Practice your aesthetic。</p>
<ul>
<li>The aesthetic of your product won’t surpass your own aesthetic.</li>
<li>Every detail shows your aesthetic.</li>
<li>Case: pulling down running wheel in friend zone.</li>
<li>Case: simple beauty. </li>
</ul>
<p>p137: Thanks!</p>
<p>p138: What I said above are all wrong.</p>
